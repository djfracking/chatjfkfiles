See 201-234750 on Tamara S.KUNGUROVA.
On his second trip to the USSR in January 1959, Philip Robert
NIELSON, REDSKIN agent was given an INTURIST interpreter/guide named
Tamara Stepanovna KUNGUROVA. A romance developed between them and NIELSON
became determined to marry her, which he finally did in the spring of 1962.
His family did everything in their power to discourage this romance and John:
Hafnes of the State Deptartment received letter from MIELSON's father re
affair.Not seeking help but advice on what to don
NIELSON later received letter from his father in fall 1960 giving in
details the contents of a conversation father had had with John Hanes of State.
Kandubokak
Hanes stated that:
a. All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccessful.
b. The Soviets never let one of their nationals out of the country under
such circumstances unless the person had been recruited as a spy.
c.The Soviets will probably not given NIELSON a visa (he tried unsuccess-
fully all summer and fall 1960 and in 1961 to get Ser visa).

With regard to the marriage of a Soviet to a foreigner, Nora
XCRZHENKO(who married a British diplomat in the 1940's) has this
to say: "Host of the women who have married foreigners must have agreed
at one time or another to carry out some sort of spy work for the Soviets.
Otherwise,they would not have been given permission to marry foreigners,
for even the marriage certificate has to be issued by the secret police."
Nora, herself, was recruited by State Security through coercion and only
allowed to leave the country by agreeing to work for Semi State Security.

that organization to the British Services. (*I Spied for Stalin by
Nora Murray).
Petr DERYABIN, State Security officer who defected in 1954, has this
to say about the Soviet women who have contact with or who marry foreigners:
Soviet women associating with foreign men will be recruited by State Security
when the association is first begun, or after it has developed, or when plans
for marriage have been made. " Even if only 5% of these women are 100%
loyal State Security workers, and the others work less loyally, it is still
considered a worthwhile operation.No woman known to be anti-Soviet would
ever be given a visa to leave the country, even if she were married to an
ambassador.The Soviets instruct all persons in this category to make remarks
against the Soviet Union when abroad, but these remarks are not to be too strong,
nor are they made for publication by press or radio."
In the early 1960s, when anyoung American was thinking of marrying an
INTURIST guide, his father contacts a knowledgeable official of the State
Department who made the following remarks:
1. All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccesful
2. The Soviets never let one of their natioanls out of the country under
such circumstances (marriage to a foreigner) unless the person had been recruited
is a spy.

It is believed that the Counterintelligence Directorate,Kipart
(Kontrrazvedyvatelnoye upravþeniye-KRU), of the KGB initiates operations
against foreigners inside the USSR. When the operation leads outside the
USSR into foreign countries,i.e., when the probable recruitments have been
achieved, and the persons in question leave the USSR, the operation is then
turned over to the Foreign Intelligence Directorate (Inostrennoye upravleniye-
which
INU) who continues the operation until such time as it is terminated.
