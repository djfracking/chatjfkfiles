Action Required:
Please advise if still desired that
Helbourne Station contact subject
1. In response to a brief letter from the undersigned,
which queried his general plans, subject has replied per
attachment. Please note that he can make himself available
after 4 November 1968 for discussions with Melbourne. The
Station defers to Bangkok and Director whether it is still
desired that we summon subject to Melbourne for talks along
the lines indicated in reference D.
For Rangoon: Note penultimate paragraph of subject's
letter in which he indicates that his daughter and family are
planning to leave Rangoon permanently. The manner in which
this is phrased leaves it unclear whether they are attempting
this overtly or working behind the scenes. The Station notes
from BANGKOK 9542 of 1 May 1968 that the daughter is married
to a Burma Air Force pilot. Since we do not have any names,
it may be unlikely that Rangoon would have any information
on the case.
